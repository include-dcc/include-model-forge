### Added Profile Restrictions

In order to ensure consistency across INCLUDE/Kids First measurements, we recommend the following:

- code **must** be from [Measurement Codes](ValueSet-measurement-vs.html).
- subject **must** be of type Patient.
- value[x] **must** be either Quantity or integer. Quantities with units are strongly preferred.
